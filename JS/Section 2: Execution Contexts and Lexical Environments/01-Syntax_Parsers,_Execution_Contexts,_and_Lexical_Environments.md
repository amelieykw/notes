# Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts, and Lexical Environment

> These three are **important**!

## Syntax Parsers

> **A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammer is valid.**

## Lexical Environment

> **Where something sits physically in the code you write.**

## Execution context

> **A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.**

There are lots of lexical environments. **Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts.** It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.
